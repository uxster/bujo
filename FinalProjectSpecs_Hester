Final project specification

//Purpose
To organize your life using the Bullet Journal method.

----------------------Project Specs-------------------------
//Problem
A to do-list works as a great organizational tool for most people. Some people on the other
hand have the feeling that simple to do-lists just don’t give them enough options (ahem, me.).
That’s where the Bullet Journal comes in place. By using different icons for different types of
to-do’s and also linking them to the days of the week, you’ll have more and better options to
organize your life. Another problem: the Bullet Journal method is pretty much meant for actually
writing with pens on paper. But who drags around a journal nowadays? Let’s make it digital!

//Target audience
The “some people” I mentioned before. People who love making lists. People who feel the need to
write down stuff because there’s chaos inside their heads. People who feel calm again after
organizing something. People who feel like simple to do-lists just aren’t satisfying anymore.

//Goals
- To learn React in preparation of my traineeship at Fleks
- To make a start on a project which I can keep on building after the course
- To make something that I'm personally proud of so I can show it on my portfolio

----------------------Business Specs------------------------
//Business model
Users can sign up for free and maybe use the basic functionality for free, but would have to pay
a monthly subscription fee to be able to use additional modules and to be able to personalize
their interface.

//Costs
Website hosting, domain name, database storage, maintenance, marketing.

//Competition
The original creators of the Bullet Journal method have an app which will help you with creating
your paper journal. Next to that, there are many simple to-do (web)apps already, like Asana,
Any.do, Wunderlist.

//USP’s
The main unique selling point is the usage of the Bullet Journal method. This simple and
easy-to-adept method will boost your to-do list to a whole different level.

//Supply/demand
Like I've stated before, there's a lot of simple to-do (web)apps already, but there's not one
I could find yet that is using the Bullet Journal method.

---------------------Technical specs----------------------

//Database
The database will have 2 tables with a one-to-many relationship:
- Table 1: Users (id, firstname, lastname, username, email, password)
This table will store information about registered users.
- Table 2: Todos (id, body, type, userId)
This table will store all the todos that users will create.

//Views
Home
Login/Register
List
Profile

//Data flow
The most complex logic in the MVP will probably be rendering the different types of to-do's.
Beyond the MVP, assigning to-do's to the days of the week and rendering the current day when
a users logs in, will be the most complex.

-----------------------Timeline-----------------------
Week 1:
- Do the React for Beginners course by Wes Bos (3-4 days)
- Decide whether or not I'm able to use React already for this assignment
- Create some designs and maybe even a small prototype (1 day)

Week 2:
- Create MVP functionality (3 days)
- Spend time on slick front-end (2 days)

If there's time left:
- Expand on MVP: Assigning to-do's to days of the week
- Expand on MVP: Assigning different colors for different agenda's
